# Voice_Dictionary

Hi this is Shantnu Gupta. I have just started to learn AI.

About Project:

I am making a project voice dictionary which will listen to words i speak and then it will provide the meaning of the word. There is one json file connected to it with words and their meaning. I am thinking in future that this dictionary will simply read the meaning of word in future. 

It is a very easy project which will advance as we move.

So if you are beginner in AI then please contribute to this project.

Thanks
BrownBatman.
